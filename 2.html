However, she caught the attention of a scout from JYP Entertainment and soon became a trainee.[6]

In March 2010, Suzy joined fellow members Fei, and Jia to form the group miss A. The trio began their first official promotional activities in China as a group by signing up with the Samsung Electronics group in China. The group released a song used for the commercial called "Love Again" for the Samsung Beat Festival. The song was written by Korean composer Super Changddai, and the music video was directed by Hong Won-ki. The group was later joined by a fourth member, Min.

The four piece girl group eventually made their debut in July 2010 through JYP Entertainment, with the single "Bad Girl Good Girl".
