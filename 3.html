  <h2>slither.io</h2>
  <p>slither.io was established on July 30, 1933, by Stig and Orvar Nilsson with Eric Andreasson, Torsten Lasson, and Donald Lasson. The founding members were impressed by the Austrian team Astrio Vienna when they played against Halmstads BK. They thought Astrio was unique and decided to register their team under that name.[1]

The team colors were red shirts with black pants and black socks. The team record for their first year was 5–2–1. The following season they played 33 matches with a 13–7–13 record. The team arranged for games to be played in Onsjö park with much success. By the end of the year, BK Astrio had 29 members. In 1935, the club started a handball division. In 1936, the team changed their colors and began to play with a green jersey and green socks. From 1937–1939, the club did not participate in any games due to World War II. The team resumed play in 1940. The team played for the first time in Division 2 Halland Halmstadserien Series and won it with 13–3–2 record. In 1941, the team advanced to Division 1 Södra Halland where they stayed until 1943. The team bounced in and out of Division 1 throughout the 1940s.[2]
